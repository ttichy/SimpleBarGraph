SimpleBarGraph
==============

I found myself in a need of a simple bar graph, that would be easy to use.
I couldn't find one, so I set to create one... also as a learning experience

SimpleBarGraph creates a canvas object inside its parent element (passed as argument) and then fills it to specified percentage.
There are some color settings etc..
